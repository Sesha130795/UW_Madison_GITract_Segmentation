This is the a semantic segmenetation project which I have done usin the UI Madison GastroIntestinal Tract dataset from kaggle. This uses the unet architecture to segment the images by producing multi channel masks. An an average validation loss of 0.0621 was achieved by training it for 10 epochs. You can ofcourse train for more epochs to see how it goes. Will be updated by me as trainng goes on in the future. The latest state dictionaries can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_VQCuxU-OL0lWW0M57N8E_vRrVEM8-dB?usp=drive_link.

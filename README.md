This is the a semantic segmentation project which I have done using the UI Madison GastroIntestinal Tract dataset from kaggle. This uses the unet architecture to segment the images by producing multi channel masks. An an average validation loss of 0.0621 was achieved by training it for 10 epochs. Will be updated as training goes on in the future. The latest state dictionaries can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_VQCuxU-OL0lWW0M57N8E_vRrVEM8-dB?usp=drive_link.
